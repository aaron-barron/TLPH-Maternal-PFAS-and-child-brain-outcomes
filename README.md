# TLPH-Maternal-PFAS-and-child-brain-outcomes
All R scripts used for statistical analysis and visualisation in The Lancet Planetary Health article: Prenatal exposure to per-fluoroalkyl substances predicts multimodal brain structural and functional outcomes in 5-year-old children: a birth cohort study (2025).

These scripts are all immediately and permanently available upon publication of the above article in 2025. 

The scripts should allow for complete replication of our analysis with your own data. If you want to reproduce our analyses with the same dataset, please see the data sharing statement from the article, below:

"For the public sharing of data, there are necessary limitations due to Finnish legislation and the ethics consent form signed by the participants in FinnBrain about publicly sharing potentially identifiable human data. In particular, while the PFAS concentrations, other serum analytes, and derived brain values pose no problem, some of the covariates included in this article contain sensitive human information, which require us to share the specific data via a trusted research environment upon request. All de-identified individual participant data and an accompanying data dictionary will be shared with researchers following approval of an ethical and methodologically sound research proposal, which should be directed to FinnBrain principal investigator, Prof. Linnea Karlsson (linnea.karlsson@utu.fi)."

If you want to replicate the entire workflow, please cite the article in The Lancet Planetary Health, Barron et al. (2025). 

For any bugs, suggestions, queries, or requests, please contact Aaron Barron (aaron.barron@utu.fi).
